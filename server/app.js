I hope this message finds you well. I noticed your role as ${contact.Title} at ${company}, and I'm impressed by the work your team is doing.

I'm reaching out from ${COMPANY}, where we specialize in ${TEAM} solutions. Given ${company}'s focus and growth trajectory, I believe there might be some interesting synergies between our organizations.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute conversation to explore potential collaboration opportunities? I'd love to learn more about your current priorities and share some insights from our work with similar companies.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
